## Chapter 4
## System Design
Containing a comprehensive description of the design chosen, how it addresses the problem,
and why it is designed the way it is.
## 4.1    Introduction
4.2    Architecture Design viewpoints
4.2.1    Context viewpoint
The Context view is often a starting point of system design. It provides a description of System’s
services and users.  That context is defined by reference to actors that include users and other
stakeholders, which interact with the design subject in its environment. The Context viewpoint
provides a “black box” perspective on the design subject.
The purpose of the Context viewpoint is to identify a design subject’s offered services, its actors
(users and other interacting stakeholders), to establish the system boundary.
In this section you can:
-  Write a description of the offered services and actors.
Design concerns: Systems services and users.

4.2. Architecture Design viewpoints9
4.2.2    Composition viewpoint
The Composition viewpoint describes the way the design subject is structured into constituent
parts and establishes the roles of those parts. The main purpose is to gain a general understand-
ing of how and why the system was decomposed, and how the individual parts work together.
The  Composition  viewpoint  supports  the  recording  of  the  part-whole  relationships  between
design entities using realization, dependency, aggregation, composition, and generalization re-
lationships.
In this section you can:
-  Provide a description of the architectural design, used architecture patterns such as MVC
or  layered  architecture.   Describe design entities  such  as:  system  decomposition  into
subsystems, components, modules; also used libraries, frameworks, software repositories.
-  Write a high level overview of how responsibilities of the system were partitioned and
then assigned to subsystems. Identify each high level subsystem and the roles or respon-
sibilities assigned to it.
-  Describe how the subsystems collaborate with each other in order to achieve the desired
functionality.
-  Use diagrams to show the major subsystems, data repositories and their interconnections
such as: architectural design and/or UML package diagram.
Design concerns: Composition and modular assembly of systems in terms of subsystems and
(pluggable) components, buy vs. build, reuse of components.
## Design Rationale
Discuss the rationale for selecting the architecture described in section 4.2.2 including criti-
cal issues and trade/offs that were considered.  You may discuss other architectures that were
considered, provided that you explain why you didn’t choose them.

4.2. Architecture Design viewpoints10
4.2.3    Logical viewpoint
The  purpose  of  the  Logical  viewpoint  is  to  elaborate  existing  and  designed  types  and  their
implementations as classes and interfaces with their structural static relationships.
Design concerns: The Logical viewpoint is used to address the development and reuse of ade-
quate abstractions and their implementations.  For any implementation platform, a set of types
is readily available for the domain abstractions of interest in a design subject, and a number of
new types is to be designed, some of which may be considered for reuse. The main concern is
the proper choice of abstractions and their expression in terms of existing types.
In this section you can:
-  Provide a UML class diagram to Illustrate static structure (classes, interfaces, and their
relationships).
-  Provide a table to describe each of your classes.
Table 4.1: ClassName
Abstract or Concrete:xxxx
## Superclassesxxxx
## Subclassesxxxx
## Purposexxxx
## Collaborationsxxxx
## Attributesxxxx
## Operationsxxxx
4.2.4    Patterns use viewpoint
This viewpoint addresses design ideas focusing on the used design patterns. UML class diagram
and the UML package diagram can be used here to illustrate the used design patterns.
## Design Rationale
You need to provide the design rationale for using these design patterns.

## 4.3. Data Design11
4.2.5    Algorithm viewpoint
In this section, provide closer look at what each component does in a more systematic way.  If
you gave a functional description, provide a summary of your algorithm for each function listed
in section 4.2.3 in procedural description language (PDL) or pseudo-code. If you gave an OOP
description, summarize each object member function for all the objects listed in 4.2.3.
Decision tables and flowcharts, “pseudo-code,” or (actual) system code may also be used.
4.2.6    Interaction viewpoint
Provides description of Object communication, messaging using UML sequence diagrams
4.2.7    Interface viewpoint
The Interface viewpoint provides programmers, and testers the means to know how to correctly
use the provided services.  This viewpoint consists of a set of interface specifications for each
entity.
NOTE: User interfaces are addressed separately in section 4.4.
## 4.3    Data Design
## 4.3.1    Data Description
Explain how the information domain of your system is transformed into data structures.  De-
scribe how the major data or system entities are stored, processed and organized.
You may consider the answer for the following questions:
-  What is the original format of the data (paper based, excel files, old system database)?
-  Identify the method used to capture the data into your system(web page forms, import
documents etc..)?
-  How large is the database expected to be (in numbers of rows and columns for the main
entities)?

## 4.3. Data Design12
-  What is the expected number of users/customers for the system?
-  How is your entity keys(ids) constructed (is there a specific code or format for ID defini-
tion)?
-  Does your data contain date/time, if yes which format are they presented in?
Provide data models diagrams such as Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) in this section.
## 4.3.2    Dataset Description
If your project includes the use of a dataset provide a clear description in this section. You need
to provide a general information on the dataset including Dataset name, link, type, and size.
You  may  also  provide  further  details  such  as  number  of  images,  tweets,  search  words,  etc.
Provide the number of classes in your dataset and the number of items, such as images, per
class. You can customize table 4.2 given the nature of your dataset.

storage items.

## 4.4. Human Interface Design13

be able to use your system to complete all the expected features and the feedback information
that will be displayed for the user.
## 4.4.2    Screen Images
Display screenshots showing the interface from the user s perspective. These can be hand drawn
or you can use a wireframe tool such as Adobe XD or you can include actual screen shots of
your GUI if already developed.

A discussion of screen objects and actions associated with those objects.
## 4.5    Implementation
Containing a comprehensive description of the implementation of your software, including the
language(s) and platform chosen, problems encountered, any changes made to the design as a
result of the implementation, etc.

## 4.7    Requirements Matrix
Provide a cross reference that traces components and data structures to the requirements in your
requirement chapter.  Use a tabular format to show which system components satisfy each of
the functional requirements from the SRS. Refer to the functional requirements by the num-
bers/codes that you gave them in the SRS as shown in Table 4.5.
